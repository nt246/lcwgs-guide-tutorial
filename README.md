# Tutorials for analysis of low-coverage whole genome sequencing data

These tutorials were developed by Matteo Fumagalli, Arne Jacobs, Nicolas Lou, and Nina Overgaard Therkildsen. An earlier version was used in the [Physalia course on Population genomic inference from low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data](https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course64/), Oct 19-22 2020
